                  Minority Report is a 2002 American cyberpunk action thriller
                  film directed by Steven Spielberg and loosely based on the
                  1956 short story "The Minority Report" by Philip K. Dick. It
                  is set primarily in Washington, D.C., and Northern Virginia in
                  the year 2054, where PreCrime, a specialized police
                  department, apprehends criminals based on foreknowledge
                  provided by psychics called "precogs". The cast includes Tom
                  Cruise as Chief of PreCrime John Anderton, Colin Farrell as
                  Department of Justice agent Danny Witwer, Samantha Morton as
                  the senior precog Agatha, and Max von Sydow as Anderton's
                  superior Lamar Burgess. (Wikipedia)

                  Fahrenheit 451 is a dystopian novel by American writer Ray
                  Bradbury, first published in 1953. Often regarded as one of
                  his best works,[4] the novel presents a future American
                  society where books are outlawed and "firemen" burn any that
                  are found.[5] The book's tagline explains the title:
                  "Fahrenheit 451 â€“ the temperature at which book paper catches
                  fire, and burns..." The lead character, Guy Montag, is a
                  fireman who becomes disillusioned with his role of censoring
                  literature and destroying knowledge, eventually quitting his
                  job and committing himself to the preservation of literary and
                  cultural writings. (Wikipedia)

                  The Time Machine is a science fiction novella by H. G. Wells,
                  published in 1895 and written as a frame narrative. The work
                  is generally credited with the popularization of the concept
                  of time travel by using a vehicle or device to travel
                  purposely and selectively forward or backward through time.
                  The term "time machine", coined by Wells, is now almost
                  universally used to refer to such a vehicle or device. (Wikipedia)

                  Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (retitled Blade Runner:
                  Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? in some later printings)
                  is a science fiction novel by American writer Philip K. Dick,
                  first published in 1968. The novel is set in a
                  post-apocalyptic San Francisco, where Earth's life has been
                  greatly damaged by a nuclear global war. Most animal species
                  are endangered or extinct from extreme radiation poisoning, so
                  that owning an animal is now a sign of status and empathy, an
                  attitude encouraged towards animals. The book served as the
                  primary basis for the 1982 film Blade Runner, and many
                  elements and themes from it were used in its 2017 sequel Blade
                  Runner 2049. (Wikipedia)

                  The Handmaid's Tale, originally published in 1985, is a
                  dystopian novel written by Canadian author Margaret Atwood. It
                  is set in a near-future New England, in a totalitarian state
                  resembling a theonomy that overthrows the United States
                  government. The Handmaid's Tale explores themes of subjugated
                  women in a patriarchal society and the various means by which
                  these women resist and attempt to gain individuality and
                  independence. The novel's title echoes the component parts of
                  Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales, which is a series of
                  connected stories ("The Merchant's Tale", "The Parson's Tale",
                  etc.). (Wikipedia)

                  Neuromancer is a 1984 science fiction novel by
                  American-Canadian writer William Gibson. It is one of the
                  best-known works in the cyberpunk genre and the first novel to
                  win the Nebula Award, the Philip K. Dick Award, and the Hugo
                  Award.[1] It was Gibson's debut novel and the beginning of the
                  Sprawl trilogy. Set in the future, the novel follows Henry
                  Case, a washed-up computer hacker who is hired for one last
                  job, which brings him up against a powerful artificial
                  intelligence. (Wikipedia)

                  Johnny Mnemonic is a 1995 Canadian-American cyberpunk action
                  thriller film directed by Robert Longo in his directorial
                  debut. The film stars Keanu Reeves and Dolph Lundgren. The
                  film is based on the story of the same name by William Gibson.
                  Keanu Reeves plays the title character, a man with a
                  cybernetic brain implant designed to store information. The
                  film portrays Gibson's dystopian view of the future with the
                  world dominated by megacorporations and with strong East Asian
                  influences. This was Dolph Lundgren's last theatrically
                  released film until 2010's The Expendables. (Wikipedia)

                  Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said (1974) concerns Jason Taverner,
                  a television star living in a dystopian near-future police state.
                  After being attacked by an angry ex-girlfriend, Taverner awakens in
                  a dingy Los Angeles hotel room. He still has his money in his wallet,
                  but his identification cards are missing. This is no minor inconvenience,
                  as security checkpoints (manned by "pols" and "nats", the police and
                  National Guard) are set up throughout the city to stop and arrest anyone
                  without valid ID. Jason at first thinks that he was robbed, but soon
                  discovers that his entire identity has been erased. There is no record
                  of him in any official database, and even his closest associates do not
                  recognize or remember him. For the first time in many years, Jason has
                  no fame or reputation to rely on. He has only his innate charm and social
                  graces to help him as he tries to find out what happened to his past while
                  avoiding the attention of the pols. The novel was Dick's first published
                  novel after years of silence, during which time his critical reputation
                  had grown, and this novel was awarded the John W. Campbell Memorial Award
                  for Best Science Fiction Novel.[4] It is the only Philip K. Dick novel
                  nominated for both a Hugo and a Nebula Award. (Wikipedia)
